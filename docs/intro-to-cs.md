**Welcome, world!**

If you’ve made it this far, it is probably safe to assume you’re interested in learning computer science.

The first course I’ll be taking on this long road toward computer science wisdom is CS50, which is taught by Harvard. It’s freely available, though you do have to pay to acquire a certificate. The course is broken up into 8 weeks, which is the structure that I hope to stick to. That said, you can pay at any time to receive this so long as you have achieved 70%+ on all the projects required.

Why CS50? It’s a great course - and similar to the type of Introduction to CS course you would get as part of a regular CS degree. If all courses were as engaging and well-adapted to the online experience as CS50 then a website like this would not be necessary. It ticks all my boxes: it’s engaging, it uses real code examples and requires you build your own projects and it also lightly touches on some of the subjects that will be covered in further down the line such as algorithms, data structures, databases, compilation and web technologies.

I’ve actually tried and failed to complete CS50 once before. I got about 3 weeks in before moving flat knocked me out of my morning study routine, which I never recovered from. Despite that, I really loved the course and I found it helpful and interesting as a web developer - who primarily uses JavaScript technologies - to experience how lower-level languages like C work.

Anyway - without further ado let's get going with week one!
